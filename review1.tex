Sleep As Android records the state of motion and the amount of exercise to estimate sleep time and assess sleep. This algorithmic mechanism
uses too few features and the logic of the judgment is relatively simple, so this results in their performance is not ideal. And Sleep
Hunter is to predict sleep stage and assess sleep by a statistical model based on some observable sleep-related events. This mechanism is
similar to our method, so we have added a deeper comparison with the algorithm in Sleep Hunter in the experimental part of the paper. That
is, making their algorithms applied to the raw sensor data of our smartwatch to prove the advantages of SLEEPGUARD and the fact that the
improvement of its accuracy is not only due to changes in equipment. The results are now given in Section 4.2.3. See also R4.1. Thanks for
the comments.
